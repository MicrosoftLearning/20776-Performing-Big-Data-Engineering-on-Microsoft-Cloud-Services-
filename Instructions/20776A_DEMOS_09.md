## Demo 1: Creating and running an Azure Data Factory pipeline

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how to:

- Prepare a local database for use with Data Factory.
- Create a new Data Factory.
- Create a Data Management Gateway.
- Create Data Factory linked services for source and sink data stores.
- Create Data Factory datasets to represent input and output data.
- Create a Data Factory pipeline with a copy activity to move the data.
- Verify the Data Factory pipeline.

### Prepare a local database for use with Data Factory

1. Ensure that the **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, **20776A-LON-DC**, and **20776A-LON-DEV** virtual machines are running, and then log on to 20776A-LON-DEV as **ADATUM\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. On the Windows **Start** menu, type **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**, and then press Enter.
3. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, in the **Server name** box, type **LON-SQL**.
4. In the **Authentication** list, click **Windows Authentication**, and then click **Connect**.
5. In Object Explorer, expand **LON-SQL**, right-click **Databases**, and then click **New Database**.
6. In the **New Database** dialog box, in the **Database name** box, type **StockPrices**, and then click **OK**.
7. In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**, right-click **StockPrices**, and then click **New Query**.
8. In the SQL Editor, type the following commands, and then click **Execute**:

    ```SQL
    USE StockPrices
    GO
    CREATE TABLE StockPriceData
    (
        Ticker VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
        ClosingPrice VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
        OpeningPrice VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
        PriceChange VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
        PercentChange VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
        HourOfLastTrade VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,
        Suspicious VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL
    )
    GO
    ```

    You can copy these commands from the file **E:\\Demofiles\\Mod09\\Demo1\\SqlCmd1.txt**

9. On the Windows **Start** menu, type **command prompt**, and then press Enter.
10. At the command prompt, run the following commands:

    ```CMD
    E:
    cd E:\Demofiles\Mod09\Demo1
    bcp StockPrices.dbo.StockPriceData in StockPriceData.csv /T /SLON-SQL /c /t,
    ```

    These commands upload sample stock price data into the **StockPricesData** table. It should read in approxiamtely 46,400 rows.

    > **Note**: Ensure that you include the comma at the end of the lst line.

    You copy these commands from the file **E:\\Demofiles\\Mod09\\Demo1\\BcpCmd1.txt**.

11. Return to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
12. In the SQL Editor, replace the existing code with the following statement, and then click **Execute**:

    ```SQL
    SELECT TOP(2000) *
    FROM StockPriceData
    GO
    ```

    You can copy this statement from the file **E:\Demofiles\Mod09\Demo1\SqlCmd2.txt**. 

    This command should display the first 2,000 rows of data; point out that the uploaded data contains stock ticker names, opening and closing prices, the price change (absolute and percentage) during the trading period, the hour of day of the last trade, and whether the trade has been marked as suspicious.

## Demo 4: Demonstration: Using the Monitoring and Management app

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how to:

- Use the Diagram view.
- Use filters.
- Pause and resume a pipeline.
- Use monitoring views.
- Use alerts.

### Use the Diagram view

1. In the Azure portal, on the stocksdf&lt;your name&gt;&lt;date&gt; blade, in the Actions section, click Monitor & Manage.
2. In the Diagram View at the top of the middle pane, use your mouse wheel or the + and - controls on the lower toolbar to zoom in and out; point out the three pipelines from the previous demos in this module.
3. In the RESOURCE EXPLORER tree view, point out the pipelines, datasets, linked services, and gateways from the previous demos.
4. In the ACTIVITY WINDOWS list at the bottom of the middle pane, point out that by default all activities are listed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent activity at the top of the list.
5. Click the top activity to show details in the Activity Window Explorer in the right pane.
6. REPHRASE THIS STEP. In the Activity Window Explorer, point out the calendar view, and show how the 15-minute data slices are represented; explain that if you used daily or weekly slices, for example, the calendar display would reflect this.
7. Scroll down and point out the summary information for this activity, including start and end time, activity name, the associated pipeline and datasets, and status information.
8. Click the cog icon to see the Properties of this activity, including more detailed execution data.
9. In the Diagram view, click Input SQL Server Dataset; point out the properties shown for this dataset in the right-hand pane.
10. Click the Script icon, to view the JSON for this dataset.
11. In the Diagram view, click Output Azure Blob Dataset; point out the properties shown for this dataset in the right-hand pane.
12. Click the Script icon, to view the JSON for this dataset.
13. In the Diagram view, click Stocks DF Pipeline.
14. In the Properties pane, click the cog icon, and point out the start and end times for the pipeline.

### Use filters

1. Click the filter for the Pipeline column.
2. In the dialog box, select the Stocks DF Pipeline check box, and then click OK.
3. Point out that using filters helps you see which activities are used by particular pipelines.
4. In the Activity Windows list, click the Copy icon.
5. In Notepad, press Ctrl+V; show that you can copy detailed activity log information for use in other applications, or for reporting.
6. Click the filter for the Status column.
7. In the dialog box, select all the check boxes except for Ready and None, and then click OK; depending on how well your previous demos performed, you might not actually see any activities at this point.
8. Click the Clear all filters icon.

### Pause and resume a pipeline

1. In the Diagram view, click ML Predictive Pipeline.
2. In the toolbar above the diagram pane, click Pause selected pipelines (the Pause button).
3. In the Pause pipelines dialog box, click OK; point out the color change to indicate the changed status.
4. To resume the pipeline, click Resume selected pipelines (the Play button).
5. In the Resume pipelines dialog box, click OK.

### Use monitoring views

1. In the left pane, click the MONITORING VIEWS icon (glasses).
2. Expand System Views, and click Failed activity windows; point out that using this view is an alternative to filtering the Activities list; again, you might not actually see any activities at this point.
3. CHECK THIS. Under System Views, click In-progress activity windows; again, depending on the state of your pipelines, you might not actually see any activities at this point. In a future update of Azure Data Factory, you will be able to create your own custom views.

### Use alerts

1. In the left pane, click the ALERTS icon (Alarm clock).
2. In the Alerts pane, click + Add Alert.
3. On the CREATE ALERT / DETAILS blade, in the Name box, type Completed activities, and then click Next.
4. On the CREATE ALERT / FILTERS blade, in the Event list, click Activity Run Finished.
5. In the Status list, click Succeeded, and then click Next.
6. On the CREATE ALERT / RECIPIENTS blade, select the Email subscription admins check box, and then click Finish.
7. In the Diagram view, right-click the Input Blob - Decision Tree activity, and then click Create alert.
8. On the CREATE ALERT / DETAILS blade, in the Name box, type Completed ML input, and then click Next.
9. On the CREATE ALERT / FILTERS blade, in the Event list, click Activity Run Started, and then click Next.
10. On the CREATE ALERT / RECIPIENTS blade, select the Email subscription admins check box, and then click Finish.
11. Open the inbox for the email address associated with your Azure subscription; steps will vary depending on the email provider.
12. You should have several alert messages; note that these might take a few minutes to arrive; point out the differences between the general alert (Completed activities), and the alert for a specific activity (Completed ML input).
13. Switch back to the Data Factory tab.
14. On the ALERTS blade, click the slider next to the Completed activities alert, to disable the alert.
15. Repeat the previous step for the Completed ML input alert.
